			During a GSE UK technical conference, I was fortunate to win an IBM z16 server Lego set. However, a year later, IBM did not bring the DS8A10 storage system Lego model to the conference, despite using it as a promotional item at other events.<br>
			Knowing that IBM had previously created Lego models for older Mainframe systems, I decided to start collecting building instructions for the DS8A10, other IBM systems, and IT-themed sets from other companies as well. <br><br>
			The older building instructions released by IBM did not include a list of brick parts (Lego Element IDs for the Pick a Brick service). Additionally, the IBM sets used printed bricks for the IBM and product logos, which I had to replace with custom stickers. I created these stickers based on the original instructions and photographs of the official sets.<br><br>
			Using the instructions below, you can order the necessary bricks from Lego's <a href="https://www.lego.com/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick" target="_blank">Pick a Brick</a> service to build the models yourself. You can also print the required stickers to add an extra touch of authenticity to your set. <br>

The set includes two color accents: blue for z16 (z/OS workloads) and yellow for LinuxONE (TuX tasks). It is composed of 184 bricks and was released in 2023.<br><br>

			The Netflix Open Connect Server Appliance is a specialized caching server designed to store and deliver Netflix content locally within internet service provider (ISP) networks, improving streaming efficiency and reducing internet traffic.<br> 
			The LEGO edition was created by Nat Morris, a former Netflix employee, as a holiday gift for his team. The original set featured multiple Open Connect Appliances (flash and storage), an Arista router, and Ken and Gina minifigures. They likely representing Ken Florance, who was Vice President of Content Delivery at Netflix, and Gina Haspilaire, who has held leadership roles in telecommunications and partnerships. Additionally, a unique box for the set was designed by Sophinie Kim, another former Netflix employee, which included several Easter eggs, such as BGP ASNs hidden in the barcode.<br>
			As I was unable to obtain the original build manual, the Netflix Open Connect Server Appliance LEGO set was recreated based on photos shared on social media, with the exception of the minifigures. This LEGO set features removable rack elements, consists of 75 bricks (excluding the minifigures, meanwhile original packaging show 120 bricks), and was originally released in 2011.<br><br>
