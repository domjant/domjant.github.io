			During a GSE UK technical conference I was one of the lucky winner of an IBM z16 server Lego set. 
			However a year later IBM didn't bought the DS8A10 storage system's Lego model to the conference, meanwhile they used it as promotion on other events.<br>
			Because I know IBM created Lego models for previous Mainframe systems before, so that point I decided to collect building instructions for DS8A10, older IBM systems, and for other companies IT sets as well. <br><br>
			The older building instructions what IBM released don't include brick parts list (Element IDs for Lego's Pick a Brick service).
			Also the IBM sets use printed bricks for IBM & product logos, which had to be subsitued with stickers. I have created those based on the old instructions and photos about the official sets.<br><br>
			Using the below instructions you can order the necessary bricks from Lego's <a href="https://www.lego.com/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick" target="_blank">Pick a Brick</a> service, to build it by your own.
			As well as print the necesarry stickers to make the set more charming. <br>
